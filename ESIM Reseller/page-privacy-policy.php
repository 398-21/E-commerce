    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4 text-gray-800">When you enter and browse the Site, we may collect two different
        types of information about you: information you provide to us, and information we collect through technology.
    </h3>

    <!-- Section Wrapper -->
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

        <!-- Information You Provide -->
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
            In order to obtain access to certain information or materials provided via the Site, you may have to provide
            information that we collect and store in a way that allows us to relate it to you personally, including but
            not limited to your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and facsimile number. We refer to
            such information as personally identifiable information. Additionally, we may collect and retain a record of
            all communications with you.
        </p>

        <!-- Information We Collect Through Technology -->
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">Information We Collect Through Technology</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
            We may collect information about you through technology. For example, we may collect your IP address each
            time you request a page during a visit to the Site. (An IP address is often associated with the portal
            through which you enter the Internet.) At times, we may also use IP addresses to collect information
            regarding the frequency with which users browse various parts of the Site.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            The Site may also use other technical methods to track and analyze the traffic patterns on the Site, such as
            the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Site. These technical methods may involve the
            transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect
            information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send our Site
            users to determine whether such users have opened those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails. We
            may collect the information from use of these technical methods in a form that is personally identifiable.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            During some visits, we may use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page
            response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as
            scrolling, clicks, and mouseovers), and methods used to browse away from the page. We may use this
            information to measure Site activity, to develop ideas for improving our websites, and for any other purpose
            to the extent permitted by applicable law.
        </p>

    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p class="mt-2">
            Galactic Roam does not disclose any nonpublic personally identifiable information about its Site users to
            any nonaffiliated third party, except as set forth below.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            We may use or disclose certain personally identifiable information we collect about you when you visit and
            browse the Site as part of our normal business operations, or to send you administrative communications
            either about your interactions with us or about features of the Site, including any future changes to this
            Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            We may also store your personally identifiable information and share it with our affiliates. We may use or
            disclose this information for marketing, research, and other business purposes, and we may associate your
            personally identifiable information with other information we collect about you, such as details about your
            usage patterns and interests, but we will not sell this information or disclose it to third parties.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            We may also use service providers to facilitate our services or platform functions on our behalf. These
            companies and individuals may have access to your personally identifiable information, as needed to perform
            their functions, but may not use it for another purpose.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            We will use or disclose personally identifiable information when we believe that such disclosures are
            required by law, regulation, legal process, subpoena, document request, or governmental request. We may also
            do so to help enforce our Terms of Use, protect your safety or security, including the safety and security
            of property that belongs to you, or protect the safety and security of our websites, databases, or third
            parties, including the safety and security of tangible or intangible property that belongs to us or to third
            parties.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            Also, in the event that Galactic Roam, or substantially all of the assets of Galactic Roam or one or more of
            its businesses, are acquired or merged with another entity, whether an affiliate or a third party, user
            information may be one of the transferred assets. We may transfer all user information (which may include
            personally identifiable information) to our acquirers or successors. Galactic Roam, however, reserves the
            right to use any personally identifiable information in any manner permitted by law.

        <p class="mt-2">
            Non-personally identifiable information is information that does not personally identify you, including
            anonymous information and aggregate data. We may use this information to understand better how our visitors
            use the Site, research our visitors’ demographics, interests, and behavior, improve the Site, provide
            visitors with customized services and information, and for other similar purposes. We may combine this
            information with personally identifiable information. We may share this information with others, such as
            investors, for information or promotional purposes, and may use this information in any manner permitted by

        <p class="mt-2">
            We endeavor to protect your personally identifiable information. We use technical, administrative, and
            physical methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including firewalls. Please be
            aware though that there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, and third parties may
            unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We will not be responsible or liable

        <p class="mt-2">
            Galactic Roam does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted
            advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. However, some third party sites
            do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what
            they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser allows you to set the DNT signal so that
            third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. You should consult the Help
            pages of your browser to learn how to set your preferences so that websites do not track you.

            Although this Site is not targeted toward children, we are concerned about the safety and privacy of
            children who use the Internet. If a child under 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us
            through the Site, a parent or guardian may inform us at the address for legal notices above, and we will use
            commercially reasonable efforts to delete it from our database, subject to applicable law and this Privacy
